# odin-recipes

This project is a siple recipe website, with a homepage and other web pages holding recipes which we will be able to access through our main page. 

Each recipe will have an image, description, ingredient list and steps.

I have demonstrated and learned the fundamentals of html, git and how to get comfortable with the command line. This was important to my understanding of how the web dev workflow is.
